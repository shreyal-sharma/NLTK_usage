# Sentiment Analysis on Solar Energy Adoption in Low-Income Communities

## The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) Library
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a popular open-source library for natural language processing (NLP) in Python.
- It provides an easy-to-use interface for a wide range of tasks, including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, parsing, and sentiment analysis.

## What is Sentiment Analysis
- Sentiment analysis is a technique used to determine the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in a text.
- It involves analyzing the words and phrases used in the text to identify the underlying sentiment, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral.

## Task
This project focuses on examining solar energy adoption and usage in low-income communities, alongside sustainable living practices. The goal is to perform sentiment analysis to capture and understand the major sentiments and emotions of participants regarding these topics.

# End-to-end Sentiment Analysis Steps 
1. Loading and displaying the dataset.
2. Downloading necessary NLTK resources.
